Assay: Any assay that produces continuous data.

Output: An .xlsx file with 2 or more sheets:
1. Summary Statistics: The mean, standard deviation, standard error of the mean, and n value for each condition within each measurement.
2. Preliminary Tests: A series of statistical tests, which determines if and what pairwise comparisons are valid. The following decision tree is followed:
  1. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: Determines if the data is not normally distributed.
    p>0.05: One-way ANOVA to determine if the groups are significantly different from each other.
      p>0.05: No groups are significantly different from each other, so pairwise comparisons are not appropiate.
      p<0.05: Levene test: Determines if the variances are different across conditions:
        p>0.05: Tukey Post-Hoc test for pairwise comparisons
        p<0.05: Games-Howell test for pairwise comparisons
    p<0.05: Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if the groups are significantly different from each other.
      p>0.05: No groups are significantly different from each other, so pairwise comparisons are not appropiate.
      p<0.05: Dunn test for pairwise comparisons
Any pairwise comparison(s) are stored as individual sheets.

Each column represents an experiment, while each row represents a sample. One column stores what condition each sample is from.

To exclude a sample from an experiment, leave the corresponding cell blank.

See comments in the code for instructions on altering variables for each analysis.
