# Geotaxis 
Assay: Flies are knocked to the bottom of a vial, and the distance climbed in several seconds (typically 5) is measured

Flies are scored with an integer 0 to 6 (including 0 and 6) indicated how high they climbed

Each vial of flies is assayed 3-4 times: After 4 assays, they begin to get tired

Each set indicates up to 7 vials of flies, with each vial stored in a unique column

Each replicate indicates an indivual assay of a set of flies. The values measured for a replicate are all measured on the same 7 rows

Additional metadata can be stored below the last replicate, including an average score for each vial
